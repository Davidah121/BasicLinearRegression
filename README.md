# BasicLinearRegression

<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This is a continuation of a previous project with the purpose of creating a equation that best fits your data.</p>
<p>This method uses Linear Regression to create a line of best fit to a set of points.</p>
<p>This program accepts a file from the command line with a list of points.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>Just like the previous project, this is another approach of fitting an equation to some data.</p>
<p>The previous approach (<a href="https://github.com/Davidah121/BasicEquationCreations">here</a>) created polynomials that
  could be very long and have odd derivatives over all of your data.</p>
<p>This method isn't as accurate since it will likely hit every point, but it does handle problems that are not equations by definition and it produces much shorter and simpler equations.</p>
